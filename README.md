Welcome to Glow
Glow is a social media platform built with Django, designed for connecting with others and sharing your experiences in a friendly environment. You can create posts, like and comment on content, personalize your profile with pictures, and use hashtags for easy navigation. Connect with friends by sending and accepting friend requests, stay updated with notifications, and quickly search for posts and users. Glow allows you to choose between dark and light modes for your comfort.

To get started, clone the repository, navigate to the project folder, install the required packages, run migrations, and start the development server. We welcome contributions, so feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request if you’d like to help improve Glow. If you have any questions or suggestions, please reach out at glowservice01@gmail.com.
